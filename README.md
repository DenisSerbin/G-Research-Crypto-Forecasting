# G-Research-Crypto-Forecasting
In spring 2022 I participated in the Kaggle competition [G-Research Crypto Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting).
I was doing pretty well in th begining of the testing phase (was holding the 142nd place among about 2000 teams after the first three weeks). But in the later stages of the testing process, as the test data was udpated, either my submissions became too slow, or unexpected errors occured, who knows - Kaggle doesn't give detailed explanations - all my submissions got discarded from the competition.

Below I'm presenting one of my models that generated a decent private score of 0.013 (the competition winner got 0.0326).
